CaM binds to RyR2 from healthy human heart with a Kd = 121 ± 14 nM only to RyR phosphorylated by PKA and CaMKII [1]
"In mice, PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 S2808 results in a 50% reduction in CaM binding to the channel. [14] Similarly, CaM binding to RyR2 is reduced in mice homozygous for the phosphomimetic RyR2 S2814D mutation. [15] In animal models and humans, heart failure is also associated with hyper-phosphorylation of RyR2 S2808 [16] and S2814.[3, 17–20]"
